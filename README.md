## About Project

This is a project created using Next.js. The project was designed based on a youtube video from lamadev and then improved by me. All the content found on the site and the functionalities were written by me. Graphics used on the blog are of my authorship, or downloaded from free sources from the Internet, such as category thumbnails. All the code, except for the sensitive data, is on GitHub.
